# Node.js-Asynchronous

This project demonstrate how to build and consume Promises instead of ending up with callback hell

callback hell ---> promises ---> async/ await

process:
1. read dog.txt (dog breed: retriever)
2. send an HTTP request to get a random image of a dog with the breed
3. save that random image to another text file

tools: 
1. (for getting dog image) 3rd party API https://dog.ceo/dog-api/
2. (for sending HTTP request) NPM Package Super Agent https://www.npmjs.com/package/superagent
